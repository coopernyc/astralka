Astralka creates "very professional" astrological natal/transit/progression chart of a person, gives flexible settings on turning on/off various thing in drawing, calculations, choose different settings, ability to create public and private collections of charts, and **the best of all** it creates aggregated prompt for AI that is based on all calculated information from the chart to apply analysis and to give overall prognosis on different areas/categories of live.

Other than to apply in practice new Angular & Typescript methods and features in building web portals or pseudo commercial products, you can also learn tons of interesting but mostly useless information regarding Astrology, Planets, Signs, Houses, Aspects etc. 

> [!WARNING] 
> Please remember, Astrology is not a science, but a mental exercise people practice from ancient times.
> Learn why girls so scared of "**Retrograde Mercury**"!!!
> You can always re-roll you luck! You don't like prediction? Try again for a new one. There's no proof or credibility either way!
> No more guessing on what bucket of flowers or gift to present on her birthday!

> [!TIP]
> on Windows, if you run into some errors about msvc for node >= 18, search and run `Install Additional tools for Node.js` batch file. 
> Also, you would need to downgrade from python 3.11+ to 3.10.x to compile `swisseph` package.
> 
> You can have several python versions, don't forget to check `Add Python to Path` option  when installing it.
> One way to use 3.10.x is to go to `Environment Variables` and change the `Path` list so 3.10 paths are before any other versions in the list.
> 
> on Linux, it fails sometimes to build swisseph or sharp dependencies. Try to use yarn instead of npm - worked for me.
