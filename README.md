> [!WARNING] 
> Please remember, Astrology is not a science, but a mental exercise people practice from ancient times.
> Forget science, embrace the fun! Astrology is a mental exercise people have enjoyed for ages, like rolling the dice on your fate. Why are girls so scared of "Retrograde Mercury?" Don't like your prediction? Just re-roll! There's no proof, no credibility, just pure entertainment. End the guessing game - no more wondering what flowers or gift to present on her birthday!

> [!TIP]
> on Windows, if you run into some errors about msvc for node >= 18, search and run `Install Additional tools for Node.js` batch file. 
> Also, you would need to downgrade from python 3.11+ to 3.10.x to compile `swisseph` package.
> 
> You can have several python versions, don't forget to check `Add Python to Path` option  when installing it.
> One way to use 3.10.x is to go to `Environment Variables` and change the `Path` list so 3.10 paths are before any other versions in the list.
> 
> on Linux, it fails sometimes to build swisseph or sharp dependencies. Try to use yarn instead of npm - worked for me.
